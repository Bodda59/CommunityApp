🌐 CommunityApp — Full-Stack Club & Community Management App

**ClubSphere** is a full-stack web application that allows clubs and communities to organize their members, publish posts, schedule events, and create interactive polls — all managed under an admin dashboard.

> 🔧 This project was built as a **skills showcase**, not for production. It's a demonstration of my ability to build scalable full-stack applications using **React (frontend)**, **Spring Boot (backend)**, and **PostgreSQL (database)**.

🎯 Project Goals

I built this project to demonstrate the following:
- My ability to design and implement a clean, modular backend using Spring Boot**
- How I handle secure database integration** with Spring Data JPA + PostgreSQL**
- Building a modern, responsive UI with React
- Understanding of full-stack architecture, component-based frontend, and REST APIs

✨ Key Features

- ✅ Admin Dashboard**: Manage the club or community, members, events, posts, and polls  
- 📝 Posts & Announcements**: Members can view updates and engage with content  
- 📅 Event Scheduling**: Admins can create and publish club events

🛠️ Tech Stack

 💻 Frontend
- React.js — component-based SPA
- Axios — for calling backend REST APIs
- React Router — navigation between pages

 🚀 Backend
- Spring Boot — modular REST API server
- Spring Data JPA — seamless database integration
- Spring Security - JWT authentication to secure login and register and requests from backend 

 🗄️ Database 
- PostgreSQL** — relational data model
- JPA Entities** — ORM mapping between Java classes and database tables

---

🧠 What This Project Demonstrates

- ✅ Full REST API design and integration
- ✅ ORM best practices using JPA and PostgreSQL
- ✅ UI/UX design using React components
- ✅ Component communication and state management
- ✅ Backend-to-database integration with real-world entities (users, posts, polls, etc.)

🔍 Why It Matters

This project shows I can:
- Think through both frontend UX and backend architecture**
- Work across the entire software stack
- Implement a real-world database schema with users, roles, posts, polls, and more
- Work independently** on full-cycle development — from database modeling to UI design
